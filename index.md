This is the website for the Data Focused Python programming course for information systems students. 

The goal of this course is to teach the data scienctist skills necessary to 
effectively gather, process, and analyze data. We avoid a lot of the theory that is
taught in introductory computer science classes in favor of covering more of the
practical side of programming that is necessary for conducting research.

Python is now being widely used in data science and scientific computing. It is easy to learn, and it has a large number of libraries available that do everything from web scraping to image manipulation to accessing databases.

Two powerful libraries for manipulating data and performing numerical
computations are the Pandas and NumPy packages, and these provide a significant performance boost over pure Python methods. However, when the data sets become very large or very computationally intensive operations need to be performed, the limitations of Python and these libraries becomes apparent.

The course is aimed at providing students with the skills necessary to use Python for data analysis. In particular the course will cover:

* Python 3.5
* The NumPy package for scientific computing
* The pandas data analysis library, including reading and writing of CSV files
* The Jupyter and PyDev development environments
* The Matplotlib 2D plotting library
* Understanding the shell
* Using Git and GitHub
* Best-practice software engineering techniques

The course will take a student-centered, active learning, approach to teaching this material. Class will typically consist of a short introductions to programming techniquess, followed by hands on computing exercises.
