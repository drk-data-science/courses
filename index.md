This is the website for the Data Focused Python programming course for information systems students. 

The goal of this course is to teach the data scienctist skills necessary to 
effectively gather, process, and analyze data. We avoid a lot of the theory that is
taught in introductory computer science classes in favor of covering more of the
practical side of programming that is necessary for conducting research.
